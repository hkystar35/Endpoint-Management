# Endpoint Management

## Getting started

My small contributions to the world, namely surrounding ~~SCCM~~ ~~MECM~~ MEMCM, PowerShell, and the PSADT.

It's been a long time coming, but I finally have the time and energy to put some thoughts out there.

A bit about me, I got my start in technology by pure happenstance and luck by working for a small 200-person company that put me through an Associate's program at my local state college for Computer Networking. After taking, and somehow passing, my CCNA classes, it became clear to me that not only did I struggle to fully understand BGB, OSPF, or collision domains, I could barely configure a router. So I opted to hang out in the Help Desk space and eventually ended up as an Endpoint Engineer.

Without sharing too much detail, I worked several years on a DoD contract, moving from inbound calls to on-site support, then on to a good-sized civil engineering company where I made the transition into endpoint management/engineering on a massive Configuration Manager environment with an actual legit reason to run a CAS. After that, I actively sought orgs with smaller environments but that offered greater responsibility and input. It's turned out to be a wise choice so far, leading me to expanding my overall experience and knowledge outside of just Windows device management.

I have no real expectations for this site other than to be a sounding board of my own misadventures in IT. Enjoy, if only for laughs.
